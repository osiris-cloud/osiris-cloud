                    Observability is the practice of monitoring the internal state of an application by collecting,
                    analyzing, and interpreting data generated by that application. Osiris CLoud goes beyond traditional
                    monitoring by offering deeper insights into how the application behaves under various conditions,
                    making it easier to detect anomalies and diagnose the root causes of issues. By capturing detailed
                    telemetry data such as logs, metrics, traces, and errors, our platform provides a holistic view of
                    your application’s health and performance.

                        With Osiris Cloud, errors and exceptions are detected in real-time,
                        allowing you to respond to issues as they happen. The platform automatically captures
                        detailed information about each error, including stack traces, local variables,
                        and contextual data like HTTP requests and user actions. This immediate visibility
                        into errors helps your team identify problems before they escalate, reducing downtime
                        and improving user satisfaction.

                        One of the most challenging aspects of fixing bugs is determining their root cause.
                        Observability with Osiris Cloud provides comprehensive context around each error, including the
                        sequence of events that led up to it (breadcrumbs), and the state of the system at the time of
                        the error. This rich context makes it easier to reproduce the issue and understand its
                        underlying cause, enabling your team to implement effective fixes faster.

                        Observability isn’t just about catching errors—it’s also about understanding and optimizing
                        application performance. Osiris Cloud tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response
                        times, latency, and resource utilization. By monitoring these metrics, your team can identify
                        performance bottlenecks and areas where your application may be slowing down. Addressing these
                        issues proactively helps prevent them from turning into more severe bugs down the line.
